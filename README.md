Node.js JavaScript DOJO API viewer and document generator

Why is this library special?
----------------------------
It's not, well not compared to the original code it was ported from. This is just a port of the exisiting php code to node.js

1. Ive got *LOADS* todo - ill list them later
2. DOJO shouldn't depend on php, that sucks
3. All UI code in templates and will be able to override
