JavaScript DOJO API viewer and document generator ran as a node module

Why is this library special?
----------------------------
It's not, well not compared to the original code it was ported from. This is just a port of the exisiting php code to node.js

1) ive got *LOADS* todo - ill list them later
2) dojo shouldn't depend on php, that sucks
