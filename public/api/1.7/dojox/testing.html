A doctest looks as if it was copied from the shell (which it mostly is).
A doctest is executed when the following conditions match:
1) all lines are comments
2) the line always starts with spaces/tabs followed by "//"
and at least one space
3) the line(s) of the test to execute starts with ">>>"
preceeded by what is described in 2)
4) the first line after 3) starting without ">>>" is the exptected result.
preceeded by what is described in 2)
5) the test sequence is terminated by an empty line, or the next
test in the following line, or a new line that does not start as described in 2)
(simple said: is not a comment)
preceeded by what is described in 2)</p>

<p>I.e. the following is a simple doctest, that will actually also be run
if you run this class against this file here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1+1 // A simple test case. Terminated by an empty line
      2</p>
      
      <p>1==2
      false
      "a"+"b" // Also without the empty line before, this is a new test.
      "ab"</p>
      
      <p>var anything = "anything" // Multiple commands for one test.
      "something"==anything
      false</p>

<p>DocTests are great for inline documenting a class or method, they also
are very helpful in understanding what the class/method actually does.
They don't make sense everywhere, but sometimes they are really handy.</p>
